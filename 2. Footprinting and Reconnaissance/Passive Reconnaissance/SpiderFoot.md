# Use SpiderFoot

SpiderFoot is an automated OSINT scanner. It is included with Kali. SpiderFoot queries over 1000 open-information sources and presents the results in an easy-to-use GUI. SpiderFoot can also be run from a console. SpiderFoot seeds its scan with one of the following:

----

+ Domain names
+ IP addresses
+ Subnet addresses
+ Autonomous System Numbers (ASN)
+ Email addresses
+ Phone numbers
+ Personal names

SpiderFoot offers the option of choosing scans based on use case, required data, and by SpiderFoot module. The use cases are:

+ All – Get every possible piece of information about the target. This use case can take a very long time to complete.
+ Footprint – Understand the target’s network perimeter, associated identities and other information that is yielded by extensive web crawling and search engine use.
+ Investigate – This is or targets that you suspect of malicious behavior. Footprinting, blacklist lookups, and other sources that report on malicious sites will be returned.
+ Passive – This type of scan is used if it is undesirable for the target to suspect that it is being scanned. This is a form of passive OSINT.

  -m mod1,mod2,...      Modules to enable.
  -M, --modules         List available modules.
  -C, --correlate scanID
                        Run correlation rules against a scan ID.
  -s TARGET             Target for the scan.
  -t type1,type2,...    Event types to collect (modules selected automatically).
  -u {all,footprint,investigate,passive}
                        Select modules automatically by use case
  -T, --types           List available event types.
  -o {tab,csv,json}     Output format. Tab is default.
  -H                    Don't print field headers, just data.
  -n                    Strip newlines from data.
  -r                    Include the source data field in tab/csv output.

Enter a name for the scan and select a target. In this case, we will use HACKTHEBOX.COM.

Select the scan use case as Footprint.

Note: The All use case scan may use active scanning. Unless you have permission to scan the target, you should avoid this setting. To be completely safe, the Passive use case should avoid any problems with unauthorized scanning.

You will scan by use case. Note that you can also scan by the type of information required or by selecting the individual scanner modules that you would like to use. By executing narrower scans, you can learn more about the modules and information that can be gathered.


Click the Run Scan Now button.

You should see a bar graph appear. The scan statistics will start to increment, and new bars will appear in the graph as new results are obtained. Mouse over the bars for a summary of the findings for that data type.

SpiderFoot scans are very detailed and can take a very long time. Give this scan at least 30 minutes so that there is a nice collection of information. To get the most details, a scan could take hours. While the scan is running, you can browse the results.

+ Go back to the scan results, by clicking the Scans tab. You will see a table with the currently running scan and any previous scans displayed.
+ Click the black square in the right-most column of the scans table to stop the scan. Some information is not available until the scan is aborted or completed.
+ Click the name of the scan in the table to return to the scan view. You will be taken to the Browse tab. Each row in the table represents data found by the various modules. Some modules contribute to multiple types of data.
+ Investigate the results.

## Register API Keys (optional).

API keys will enhance the functionality of SpiderFoot. Some of these API keys require free registration. The pentesting tools that are available are constantly evolving. Some tools or services that were once free and open can become fee-based over time.

Note: Some APIs may limit your results after you have reached a prescribed number of uses.

+ Go to the Settings tab.
+ Find the four modules in the table below. Open the page for the module and complete the table including the type of information that module searches for. For each module in the table, click the ? next to the API option. Follow the instructions to get API keys for the four modules.
